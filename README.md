This project acts like a cheat code for word games.
Its functionality is currently limited to generating a list of words and it canâ€™t do any more than that.
You just have to run the code and write as an input, the letters you want the code to work with. You enter a minimum amount of words you want the generated words to have and also set a maximum. The code works with this and gives you a list of words that are in the dictionary used, in descending order (longer words first).
The words you get as an output can be used as hints to playing word games in which you have to provide words in order to move on to the next level.
I hope you like it!!!
